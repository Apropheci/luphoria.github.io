        <div id="text">This is the first post in this epic blog. Most of what I'm talking about here is for XSS (cross-site scripting), which is a hacking method that abuses problems generally with user input on websites to hack them.</div>
        <div id="text">currently i'm working on refining my gmail xss, which could get me up to <i>$12,500</i> in rewards from google. now I think that's ridiculous, but also really great.</div>
        <div id="text">basically, i have the full xss method finished (which will be released once i've gotten a response from google), but as an example of how powerful it could be i'm going to also add a video of me using it as an email work before reporting it. Wish me luck!</div>
